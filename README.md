# NN-PFP
`NN-PFP` (Neural Network Photonic Fabrication Predictor) is a package for modelling fabrication process induced variations in integrated photonic devices with deep convolutional neural networks.

The package includes the tools used in the paper `Deep Learning Based Prediction of Fabrication-Process-Induced Structural Variations in Nanophotonic Devices` (which can be viewed here), for generating and processing training data, training predictor models, and using the predictor models on photonic designs. It also includes pretrained models and the data they're trained on.
